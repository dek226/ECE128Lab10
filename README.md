# The purpose of this memory storage interaction lab is to get accustomed to Verilog coding and how ROM, RAM, and RF work at a lower level in the Vivado environment. 
# Another purpose is to provide more modular programming practice through instantiation and utilization of many components/modules. Then design a test bench utilizing the techniques learned in class for efficiency and better practice, and learn how to display the different modules wires in the top unexpanded view in the waveform.
